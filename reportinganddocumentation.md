## **1. Introduction**

The objective of this document is to provide a comprehensive guide for a project involving the migration of data from a relational database management system (RDBMS) to a NoSQL database, specifically a key-value store. A common challenge in such projects is identifying a suitable use case where this migration offers tangible benefits, thereby justifying the choice of NoSQL technology and the migration effort itself. This report directly addresses this challenge by proposing "User Session Management" as a compelling use case.

This document details the design of an appropriate relational database schema for managing user sessions, demonstrates how this data can be effectively modeled in Redis (a leading key-value store), and outline a programmatic strategy for migrating the data.

The subsequent sections will systematically cover:

- The selection and justification of User Session Management as the use case, with Redis as the chosen key-value store.
- The design of a relational database, including table structures, relationships, and sample data considerations.
- The data modeling approach in Redis, translating the relational schema into an optimized key-value structure.
- A strategy for programmatic data migration, encompassing extraction, transformation, loading, error handling, and verification.

## **2. Selecting and Justifying a Key-Value Use Case: User Session Management**

A critical first step in migrating from a relational database to a NoSQL solution is selecting an appropriate use case that benefits from the NoSQL database's specific characteristics. For a migration to a key-value store, User Session Management presents an excellent candidate.

### **Why User Session Management?**

User session management involves tracking user interactions with an application over a period of time. This typically includes data such as user identifiers, session tokens, authentication status, user preferences, shopping cart contents, last activity timestamps, and IP addresses.1 Initially, many applications might store this data in a relational database due to familiarity or existing infrastructure. However, as the application scales and the number of concurrent users grows, RDBMS can exhibit limitations for this specific workload:

- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Session data requires extremely fast read and write access. For instance, updating a user's last activity timestamp or modifying items in a shopping cart are frequent operations. Relational databases, especially when disk-based, can struggle to provide the consistent low-latency responses needed for a smooth user experience at high throughput.1
- **Scalability Challenges:** While RDBMS can scale, horizontal scaling (sharding) is often complex to implement and manage. Vertical scaling (increasing server resources) has physical and cost limits.6 Session stores, by nature, need to handle a rapidly fluctuating number of active sessions.
- **Complex Queries for Simple Data:** Retrieving a complete session object in an RDBMS might involve joining multiple tables (e.g., user details, session metadata, user preferences, cart items). For session retrieval, which is often a lookup by a session ID, these joins can become an unnecessary overhead.6

### **Introducing Redis as the Key-Value Store of Choice**

Redis is a high-performance, in-memory data structure store, widely used as a database, cache, and message broker.5 Its architecture and feature set make it particularly well-suited for managing user sessions. The justification for choosing Redis rests on several key characteristics:

- **Exceptional Performance:** Being primarily an in-memory database, Redis offers extremely fast read and write operations, often in the sub-millisecond range.2 This is crucial for session management where quick data access directly impacts application responsiveness.
- **Scalability:** Redis supports various scalability patterns, including clustering, which allows for horizontal scaling by distributing data across multiple nodes.3 This enables the session store to grow with the user base.
- **Data Model Compatibility:** Redis is not just a simple key-value store; it supports various data structures. Redis Hashes are particularly well-suited for storing session objects. A hash can represent a session as a collection of field-value pairs (e.g., user_id, ip_address, last_activity), all stored under a single session key.3 This model aligns well with the denormalized data often preferred in NoSQL for performance.
- **Built-in Data Expiry (TTL):** Redis allows a Time-To-Live (TTL) to be set on keys. When a key expires, Redis automatically deletes it.3 This feature is invaluable for session management, as sessions naturally have an expiration time. Automating session cleanup simplifies application logic and prevents the accumulation of stale data, a task that would require manual jobs or triggers in an RDBMS.
- **Simplicity for the Use Case:** For retrieving session data (typically by a session ID), the key-value model offers a simpler and more direct access path compared to SQL queries involving joins.1

The migration from an RDBMS to a key-value store like Redis for session management is often driven by the need to offload a specific type of workload where the RDBMS's strengths (like complex transactional integrity across many tables) are less critical than raw speed and scalability for relatively simple data structures. Session data often fits this profile: it's frequently accessed, needs to be retrieved quickly, and its structure per session is often self-contained once denormalized. Redis Hashes provide a natural way to represent these denormalized session objects, effectively collapsing data that might have been spread across multiple relational tables into a single, efficient structure.6

To further illustrate the advantages, the following table compares a traditional RDBMS with Redis specifically for the user session management use case:

**Table 1: RDBMS vs. Redis for User Session Management**

| **Feature** | **Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)** | **Redis (Key-Value Store)** | **Justification for Session Management** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary Data Storage | Disk-based | Primarily In-memory (with persistence options) | Faster access for frequently needed session data |
| Data Model | Normalized tables, relationships | Key-Value pairs (e.g., Hashes for objects) | Simpler, faster retrieval; avoids complex joins for session attributes |
| Read/Write Speed | Moderate to Fast (depends on indexing) | Extremely Fast | Critical for responsive UI and frequent session updates |
| Scalability | Vertical, complex horizontal sharding | Horizontal (clustering) | Easily handles growing numbers of concurrent user sessions |
| Session Expiry | Manual implementation (jobs, triggers) | Built-in TTL (Time-To-Live) | Automatic cleanup of stale sessions, reducing application complexity and database bloat |
| Complexity (for task) | Higher (schema, joins, ACID overhead) | Lower | Simpler data access patterns for session data |

### Choosing Redis over other NoSQL Databases

Compared to other NoSQL databases, Redis stands out for session management due to its in-memory architecture, which delivers unmatched speed and low latency for read/write operationsâ€”far faster than disk-based NoSQL options like MongoDB or Cassandra. While many NoSQL databases offer flexibility and complex querying, Redisâ€™s simple key-value and native data structures (like Hashes) are perfectly suited for the straightforward, frequent lookups and updates required by user sessions. Its built-in TTL support automates session expiration, reducing maintenance overhead. Additionally, Redisâ€™s efficient clustering enables easy horizontal scaling with minimal complexity. These features make Redis the clear choice over other NoSQL systems when prioritizing high performance, scalability, and simplicity for managing

Below is a table illustrating the key reasons why Redis is preferred over MongoDB for user session management.

**Table 2: MongoDB vs. Redis for User Session Management**

|  | **MongoDB (Document-Based NoSQL DB)** | **Redis (Key-Value NoSQL DB)** | **Justification for Session Management** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Model** | Document store (flexible JSON-like BSON documents). | Key-Value store (simple key-value pairs). | User session data is simpleâ€”just a session ID and some user info. Redisâ€™s fast key-value model is perfect for this, while MongoDBâ€™s document model adds unneeded complexity. |
| **Primary Storage** | Primarily **disk-based** (though enterprise versions offer in-memory storage engines). | Primarily **in-memory** (with configurable options for data persistence to disk). | Redis stores data in RAM, enabling sub-millisecond reads/writesâ€”crucial for fast session management. MongoDB, being disk-based, has higher latency even with caching. |
| **Performance** | Optimized for complex queries and large datasets; good for write-heavy workloads. | Exceptional speed for simple, atomic operations; optimized for very high throughput. | Session management needs high speed and throughput. Redis handles hundreds of thousands of simple operations per second, keeping apps responsive under load. MongoDB isnâ€™t built for this level of performance with ephemeral data. |
| **Data Types** | BSON documents (supports nested structures and arrays). | Strings, Hashes, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets (rich, purpose-built data structures). | Redis Hashes natively store session attributes as field-value pairs under one key, offering better performance than MongoDBâ€™s general document model. |
| **Querying Capability** | Rich query language (MongoDB Query Language - MQL), aggregations, full-text search. | Simple key-based lookups; limited complex querying within values. | Session management relies on fast key lookups by session ID. Redis does this in O(1) time, while MongoDBâ€™s complex queries add unnecessary overhead. |
| **Data Persistence** | High data durability by default (on-disk storage, replica sets for high availability and fault tolerance). | Offers various persistence mechanisms (snapshotting (RDB), Append-Only File (AOF)), but its primary function is in-memory. | Redis offers optional persistence without sacrificing speedâ€”ideal for temporary session data. MongoDBâ€™s strong persistence is overkill for such short-lived use. |
| **Memory Usage** | Efficient for very large datasets as data primarily resides on disk; can scale beyond RAM capacity. | All active data resides in memory; can be more costly for extremely large datasets that don't fit into RAM. | Session data is small, short-lived, and fits in memory, making Redis ideal. Its speed outweighs the higher RAM use, with TTLs ensuring old data is auto-removed. |
| **Time-To-Live (TTL)** | Requires manual implementation or complex application-level logic for data expiration and cleanup. | **Built-in TTL functionality for keys** (automatic expiration). | Redisâ€™s EXPIRE command makes session expiration automatic, simplifying cleanup and preventing stale data buildupâ€”perfect for managing short-lived sessions with minimal effort. |
| **Scalability** | Horizontal scalability via sharding and replica sets (mature and widely adopted for large-scale data distribution). | Horizontal scalability via **Redis Cluster** for sharding; master-replica for read scaling and high availability. | Redis Cluster scales session data efficiently with low overhead, keeping fast performance under load. MongoDB sharding is powerful but heavier for simple, short-lived data. |
| **Concurrency** | Handles high concurrency well with its multi-threaded architecture for read/write operations. | Single-threaded event loop, but achieves extremely high concurrency by rapidly processing a queue of requests. | Redisâ€™s single-threaded event loop handles high concurrency efficiently, making it perfect for simple, fast session operations without multi-threading overhead. |

## **3. Designing the Relational Database for User Session Management**

To effectively demonstrate the migration process, a well-defined relational database schema is essential. This schema will serve as the source for the data to be migrated to Redis. The design must include at least four tables with appropriate relationships and constraints, and be capable of holding meaningful data.

### **Conceptual Overview**

The relational database will be designed to store information related to users and their sessions. The core entities are:

- **Users:** Represents individuals who can log into the application.
- **UserSessions:** Tracks active sessions for users, including metadata like IP address and expiration.
- **SessionData:** Stores arbitrary key-value data associated with a specific session, such as shopping cart items or temporary application state. This design provides flexibility.
- **UserPreferences:** Contains user-specific settings, like theme or language preferences.

This structure provides a normalized representation of session-related information, typical of an RDBMS approach.

### **Detailed Table Structures (SQL DDL)**

The following SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statements define the tables, their columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and other integrity constraints. A common RDBMS like PostgreSQL syntax is used for illustration.

**Table 2: Relational Database Schema for User Session Management (SQL DDL)**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
   user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
   email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
   password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   last_login_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);

-- User sessions table
CREATE TABLE user_sessions (
   session_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
   user_id INT NOT NULL,
   ip_address VARCHAR(45),
   user_agent TEXT,
   created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
   last_activity_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   CONSTRAINT fk_user
       FOREIGN KEY(user_id)
       REFERENCES users(user_id)
       ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Session data table
CREATE TABLE session_data (
   session_data_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   session_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   attribute_key VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   attribute_value TEXT,
   created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   CONSTRAINT fk_session
       FOREIGN KEY(session_id)
       REFERENCES user_sessions(session_id)
       ON DELETE CASCADE,
   CONSTRAINT unique_session_attribute UNIQUE (session_id, attribute_key)
);

-- User preferences table
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
   preference_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   user_id INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
   theme VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'light',
   language VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'en',
   notifications_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
   updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   CONSTRAINT fk_user_prefs
       FOREIGN KEY(user_id)
       REFERENCES users(user_id)
       ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### **Relationships and Integrity Constraints**

The schema employs several integrity constraints to maintain data consistency:

- **Primary Keys (PK):** user_id, session_id, session_data_id, preference_id uniquely identify rows in their respective tables.
- **Foreign Keys (FK):**
    - UserSessions.user_id references Users.user_id, ensuring a session belongs to a valid user.
    - SessionData.session_id references UserSessions.session_id, linking attributes to a specific session.
    - UserPreferences.user_id references Users.user_id, associating preferences with a valid user.
    - ON DELETE CASCADE is used to automatically remove related data (sessions, session data, preferences) if a user or session is deleted, simplifying data management.
- **Unique Constraints:**
    - Users.username and Users.email must be unique.
    - SessionData.session_id and SessionData.attribute_key together must be unique, preventing duplicate attribute keys within the same session.
    - UserPreferences.user_id is unique, enforcing one preference record per user in this model.
- **Not Null Constraints:** Ensure essential data fields are always populated.

## **4. Data Modeling in Redis: From Relational Tables to Key-Value Pairs**

Migrating data from a relational model to a key-value store like Redis involves transforming the structured, normalized data into a format suitable for efficient key-based access. The primary principle guiding this transformation is denormalization for performance: instead of relying on joins at query time, related data is often grouped together under a single key.6 The design of the Redis data model should be driven by the application's access patternsâ€”how session data will be primarily retrieved and used. For user sessions, this is almost always by the unique session identifier.

### **Key Design Strategies for Session Data in Redis**

- **Primary Session Key:** A consistent key naming convention is vital for organization and avoiding collisions in Redis's global keyspace.10 A common pattern is to use a prefix indicating the data type, followed by the unique identifier. For sessions, the key will be session:<session_id>, where <session_id> is the same identifier used in the UserSessions.session_id column of the RDBMS. For example, session:a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef.
- **Storing Session Objects with Redis Hashes:** Redis Hashes are an ideal data structure for representing objects like user sessions.3 A hash is a collection of field-value pairs stored at a single key. This allows for the denormalization of data from multiple relational tables (Users, UserSessions, SessionData, UserPreferences) into one comprehensive session object in Redis.

    An example structure for a Redis Hash at key session:<session_id> might include fields such as:

    - user_id: (from UserSessions.user_id)
    - username: (denormalized from Users.username by joining on user_id)
    - email: (denormalized from Users.email)
    - ip_address: (from UserSessions.ip_address)
    - user_agent: (from UserSessions.user_agent)
    - session_created_at: (from UserSessions.created_at, as a string or Unix timestamp)
    - last_activity_at: (from UserSessions.last_activity_at, as a string or Unix timestamp)
    - theme: (denormalized from UserPreferences.theme)
    - language: (denormalized from UserPreferences.language)
    - notifications_enabled: (denormalized from UserPreferences.notifications_enabled, as 'true'/'false' or '1'/'0')
    - Specific attributes from SessionData:
        - If SessionData contains, for example, attribute_key = 'cart_items_json' and attribute_value = '{"itemA":1, "itemB":2}', this can become a field in the hash: cart_items_json: '{"itemA":1, "itemB":2}'.
        - Alternatively, multiple SessionData rows can be aggregated into a single JSON string stored in one hash field, or individual attribute_key values can become distinct fields in the Redis hash if their names are known and limited.

When storing complex data structures like a shopping cart (which might be a list of items with quantities and prices) within a Redis Hash field, serialization is necessary because hash fields themselves store string values. JSON is a common and convenient format for this purpose.10 The application would serialize the cart to a JSON string before storing it in the hash and deserialize it after retrieval.

### **Mapping Relational Data to Redis Hashes**

The migration script will be responsible for querying the RDBMS (likely using joins to gather all necessary information for a session) and then constructing these Redis Hashes.

- The session_id from UserSessions becomes the primary Redis key.
- Relevant fields from the Users table (like username, email) are fetched by joining UserSessions with Users on user_id and included directly in the session hash.
- Relevant fields from UserPreferences (like theme, language) are similarly fetched by joining on user_id and added to the hash.
- Data from the SessionData table, which is already somewhat key-value like, needs careful handling. One approach is to iterate through all SessionData rows for a given session_id and add each attribute_key and attribute_value pair as a field in the Redis Hash. If attribute_value itself contains structured data (e.g., a JSON object representing a product), it will be stored as a string.

### **Setting Time-To-Live (TTL) on Session Keys**

A significant advantage of Redis for session management is its native support for key expiry.3 The expires_at timestamp from the UserSessions table in the RDBMS can be used to set a TTL on the corresponding session:<session_id> key in Redis.

- The EXPIRE command sets a TTL in seconds from the current time.
- The EXPIREAT command sets an expiration time using a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch). When the TTL is reached, Redis automatically removes the key and its associated hash, ensuring that stale sessions do not persist indefinitely.9 This simplifies application logic significantly compared to manually managing session expiry in an RDBMS.

The following table provides a concrete example of how data from related rows across different RDBMS tables can be denormalized and mapped into a single Redis Hash.

**Table 3: Example Mapping: Relational User Session Data to Redis Hashes**

| **Relational Source** | **RDBMS Data Example (Illustrative)** | **Redis Key** | **Redis Hash Field** | **Redis Hash Value (String Representation)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UserSessions.session_id | a1b2-c3d4-e5f6 | session:a1b2-c3d4-e5f6 | (Key Itself) |  |
| UserSessions.user_id | 101 | session:a1b2-c3d4-e5f6 | user_id | 101 |
| Users.username (for user_id 101) | jane_doe | session:a1b2-c3d4-e5f6 | username | jane_doe |
| UserSessions.ip_address | 203.0.113.45 | session:a1b2-c3d4-e5f6 | ip_address | 203.0.113.45 |
| UserPreferences.theme (for user_id 101) | dark | session:a1b2-c3d4-e5f6 | theme | dark |
| SessionData (where attribute_key='cart_json', session_id='a1b2-c3d4-e5f6') | {"item1":"prodX","qty":2} | session:a1b2-c3d4-e5f6 | cart_items | {"item1":"prodX","qty":2} |
| UserSessions.expires_at | 2024-12-31 23:59:59 UTC | session:a1b2-c3d4-e5f6 | (TTL Mechanism in Redis) | (Set to expire based on this timestamp) |

This mapping strategy ensures that all data relevant to a user's session can be retrieved from Redis with a single HGETALL session:<session_id> command, offering significant performance gains over multiple SQL joins.

## **5. Programmatic Data Migration: RDBMS to Redis**

Migrating data from the designed relational database to Redis requires a programmatic approach. A script, for instance in Python, can automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process. Python is a suitable choice due to its excellent database connectivity libraries (e.g., psycopg2 for PostgreSQL, mysql-connector-python for MySQL) and a robust Redis client library (redis-py).11

### **Overview of the Migration Script**

The migration script should be structured modularly, with distinct functions for:

1. Connecting to the source RDBMS.
2. Connecting to the target Redis instance.
3. Extracting data from the RDBMS.
4. Transforming the extracted data into the desired Redis format.
5. Loading the transformed data into Redis.
6. Performing basic verification.

### **Step 1: Extracting Data from the Relational Database**

The first step involves connecting to the RDBMS and querying the necessary data.11 To construct the comprehensive session objects for Redis, SQL queries will likely need to join the UserSessions table with Users, UserPreferences, and aggregate data from SessionData.

A conceptual SQL query to fetch the required data might look like this:

```sql
SELECT
us.session_id
us.user_id,
us.ip_address,
us.user_agent,
us.created_at AS session_created_at,
us.expires_at,
us.last_activity_at,
u.username,
u.email,
up.theme,
up.language,
up.notifications_enabled,
(
SELECT json_object_agg(sd.attribute_key, sd.attribute_value)
FROM SessionData sd
WHERE sd.session_id = us.session_id
) AS session_specific_attributes
FROM UserSessions us
JOIN Users u ON us.user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN UserPreferences up ON us.user_id = up.user_id;
```

This query attempts to gather all related information for each session. The session_specific_attributes column uses json_object_agg to collect all key-value pairs from SessionData for a given session into a single JSON object. For very large datasets, data should be fetched in manageable chunks to avoid memory issues 6, though for the project's scale (15-20 records per table), a single fetch will likely suffice.

### **Step 2: Transforming Data for Redis**

Once data is extracted, it must be transformed to fit the Redis data model designed in Section 4.6 This involves iterating through each relational record (representing a session with its joined data) and:

- **Constructing the Redis Key:** For each session, create the key, e.g., f"session:{row['session_id']}".
- **Building the Hash Dictionary:** Create a Python dictionary that will represent the Redis Hash.
- **Mapping Fields:** Map columns from the RDBMS result set to fields in the Python dictionary. For example, row['username'] becomes the value for the username field in the dictionary.
- **Data Type Conversions:** This is a critical step, as Redis Hashes store string values for fields and their corresponding values.8
    - Timestamps (like session_created_at, expires_at) should be converted to a standardized string format (e.g., ISO 8601) or to Unix timestamps (integers).
    - Boolean values (like notifications_enabled) should be converted to string representations (e.g., 'true'/'false', or '1'/'0').
    - Numeric types can be stored as strings.
    - The session_specific_attributes (which is already a JSON object string from the query) can be stored directly or further processed if needed. If it's None (e.g., no entries in SessionData), it should be handled appropriately (e.g., omit the field or store an empty JSON object string {}).
- **Handling NULLs:** Data from LEFT JOINs (e.g., if a user has no preferences, theme might be NULL) must be handled. Options include omitting the field from the Redis Hash, storing a specific placeholder string (e.g., "N/A"), or an empty string, depending on application requirements.6

### **Step 3: Loading Data into Redis**

After transformation, the data is loaded into Redis.7

- **Connect to Redis:** Establish a connection.
- **Store Hash Data:** For each transformed session (represented as a Python dictionary), use the HSET command to store it in Redis. The HSET command can set multiple field-value pairs in a hash in one operation if the dictionary is passed as the mapping argument. Example: redis_connection.hset(name=redis_key, mapping=session_dictionary).
- **Set TTL:** After storing the hash, set its Time-To-Live using the EXPIRED command with the Unix timestamp derived from the expires_at value of the session. Example: redis_connection.expireat(name=redis_key, when=int(expiry_timestamp.timestamp())).

For migrating a large number of keys, Redis Pipelining can significantly improve performance by batching multiple commands and sending them to the server in a single request-response cycle. While not strictly necessary for the project's scale, mentioning it demonstrates awareness of performance optimization techniques.

### **Implementing Error Handling and Logging Mechanisms**

Robust error handling is crucial for any data migration task.6

- **Connection Errors:** Wrap database connection attempts (both RDBMS and Redis) in try-except blocks to catch and log failures.
- **Data Extraction/Transformation Errors:** Handle potential errors during SQL execution or data conversion (e.g., unexpected None values, type conversion issues).
- **Redis Operation Errors:** Catch exceptions during HSET or EXPIRE operations.
- **Logging:** Implement logging (to console or a file) for errors, successful operations, and migration progress. This helps in debugging and monitoring.6
- **Failed Records Strategy:** Decide how to handle records that fail during transformation or loading. Options include skipping the record and logging the error, retrying a few times, or halting the entire migration. For this project, logging the error and skipping the problematic record might be a pragmatic approach.

A migration script designed to be idempotent is often beneficial. This means that running the script multiple times with the same source data will result in the same state in the target system. For this session management use case, using HSET with the session:<session_id> key naturally achieves this, as subsequent runs will simply overwrite the existing hash with the latest data from the RDBMS.

### **Data Verification Strategies Post-Migration**

After the migration script completes, verifying the data integrity is essential.6

- **Count Verification:** Compare the number of session records in the RDBMS UserSessions table with the number of session:* keys in Redis (e.g., using DBSIZE or SCAN session:* COUNT).
- **Random Sampling and Deep Dive:**
    - Select a few session_ids randomly.
    - Fetch the complete session data for these IDs from the RDBMS (performing the necessary joins and transformations as the script would).
    - Retrieve the corresponding Hash from Redis using HGETALL session:<selected_session_id>.
    - Compare all fields, ensuring data types (after transformation) and values match.
- **TTL Verification:** For the sampled keys, check their TTL in Redis using the TTL session:<selected_session_id> command to ensure expiry is set correctly.
- **Query Performance (Qualitative):** While not a formal benchmark for this project, one could note the ease and speed of fetching a session object from Redis versus the RDBMS.

The following table outlines the key functional components of a Python-based migration script:

**Table 4: Key Components of the Python Migration Script**

| **Function/Module Name** | **Purpose** | **Key Libraries/Operations** | **Error Handling Considerations** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| connect_to_rdbms() | Establishes connection to the relational database. | psycopg2.connect() (or equivalent for other RDBMS) | Connection errors, authentication failures. |
| connect_to_redis() | Establishes connection to Redis. | redis.Redis() | Connection errors, Redis server unavailable. |
| extract_session_data() | Queries RDBMS to fetch all relevant session and related user/preference data. | SQL SELECT with JOINs, cursor.fetchall() | SQL syntax errors, empty result sets. |
| transform_data_for_redis() | Converts a single RDBMS row (or joined result) into a Redis Hash dictionary. | Dictionary manipulation, JSON serialization, date formatting | Type conversion errors, missing expected data fields. |
| load_session_to_redis() | Writes a session hash to Redis and sets its TTL. | redis_conn.hset(), redis_conn.expireat() | Redis command errors, network issues during write. |
| main_migration_process() | Orchestrates the entire migration: connect, extract, transform, load. | Calls to other functions, loop through extracted data | Overall process failure, logging summary statistics. |
| verify_migration() | Implements basic data verification checks post-migration. | RDBMS queries, Redis HGETALL, TTL, data comparison | Data mismatches, missing keys, incorrect TTLs. |

This structured approach, combined with careful attention to data type conversions 6 and error handling, will facilitate a successful and verifiable migration.
